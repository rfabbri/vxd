SHORT TERM

- rename dbnl_eno_zerox_label to dbnl_eno_zerox_label_1d
-  " "   dbnl_eno_zerox_label to dbnl_eno_zerox_label_1d

- write down weak cases of the algorithm (e.g. shocks with no intersection, etc)

- use of stride?


- general order ENO
   - general order root finding-- better use vnl_real_poly

MEDIUM TERM

- better error treatment
- improve doc
- see remaining funs in original ENO, whichever I dont understand
- see TODO and XXX in:
   vision-code/eno/documentation-rfabbri.txt


=========================
VERY MINOR POINTS

- polynomial implementation could be made much more efficient by
making it totally specific for 2nd order polynomials. E.G.:
   instead of:
      interpolant.poly_.coef[i]
   do just:
      intepolant.coef_1
      intepolant.coef_2
      intepolant.coef_3

   This way we could save a lot of indirections and space for pointers.

- if you think this ENO is too slow for you app, let me know and
perhaps I'll try to optimize it.
